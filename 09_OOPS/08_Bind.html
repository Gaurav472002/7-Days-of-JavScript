            // along with the button reference we are also sending the properties of the class to the handleClick function using the bind

/*In simple terms, the bind method in this code is used to ensure that when a function is called as an event handler (like handleClick in this
case), the this keyword inside that function refers to the instance of the class where the method is defined.

When you attach an event listener to an HTML element and specify a function as the event handler, by default, the this keyword inside that
function refers to the element itself, not to the class instance.

So, by using bind(this) when attaching the event listener, you're essentially telling JavaScript to make sure that inside the handleClick method, 
this refers to the instance of the React class where the method is defined. This allows you to access properties and methods of the class 
using this inside the event handler.

In this specific code:

Without bind(this), this.server and this.username inside the handleClick method would be undefined because this would refer to the button element, 
not the class instance.
With bind(this), this.server and this.username inside the handleClick method correctly refer to the properties of the React class instance. */
