    undefined --> this means value defined hi nahi hai
    symbol -->  to denote unique data types
    bigInt
    object --> null is of type object*/

/* we can use null to represent we got nothing like if we fetch data from a server and we got nothing then we can represent it using null */

//  when to use ; ?

// try to write code in different lines as well this style of coding is not recommended at all
console.log(3+3) ; console.log("Gaurav")

// original documentation of tc39.es is available here all the standards are defined here

// dataTypes in JS

let name = "Gaurav"
let age =   18
let loggedIn = true;
console.log(typeof null)
console.log(typeof undefined) // type of undefined is undefined
